# search-engine-php
A complete search engine written in PHP. 

This is a full featured search engine that Iâ€™ve built over the past couple years as I was learning PHP.
It includes a spell checker, calculator, encryption, admin interface, search history, keyword wikipedia integration, 
definition look up, and a lot more features. I was pretty much trying to clone Google in PHP.

This is a full featured search engine that I've built over the past couple years as I was learning PHP. It includes a spell checker, calculator, encryption for search results, admin interface (ability to add websites without having them crawled), search history, keyword wikipedia integration, definition look-up, and quite a bit more features. I was pretty much trying to replicate some of the things Google does in PHP.

Note, this script is not maintained any more, this used to be a project in 2013-2015.
